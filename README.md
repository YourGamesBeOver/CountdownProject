# CountdownProject
EECS393 Project for Gold team


To run:
clone the project, open the sln file using the latest version of Visual Studio and hit run (ensure that you're building for x86 or x64 first!).

You will need the latest versions of Windows 10 and Visual Studio with the UWP (Universal Windows 10) SDK.  

You may also need to enable developer mode on your Windows 10 PC.  Search the settings app for "developer" to find this setting.
